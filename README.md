# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection System

## 📌 Overview
This AI-powered system detects and classifies tomato leaf diseases. Using deep learning (YOLO model), it analyzes leaf images to identify whether they are healthy or infected by common tomato diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, Septoria Leaf Spot, Mosaic Virus, and more.  

It helps farmers, researchers, and agriculturists with early diagnosis to prevent crop loss and improve yields.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Multi-class disease detection (10 classes, including "Healthy")  
- ✅ Works with uploaded tomato leaf images  
- ✅ Real-time detection (optional with webcam or mobile app)  
- ✅ Pre-trained models included for quick testing  
- ✅ Custom training on new datasets
